### lnclt Custom Arch Linux Repository

These are build tools, PKGBUILDs and an install script to make the installation of Arch Linux from a live medium
to a familiar system environment as quick and painless as possible.


#### Special Thanks
[mdaffin](https://github.com/mdaffin/arch-pkgs), who's blog post inspired me to do this, and who's repository 
was a tremendous help in getting the first version of this project started.
