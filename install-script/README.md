### Arch Linux Setup Script

This script takes away the tediousness of the initial Arch Linux installation.

#### Disclaimer

This is more of a personal tool and not really meant to be widely adopted or even a "newbie help". If you haven't installed Arch 'by hand' before, 
you will only create more problems for yourself later if you blindly follow guides or install scripts such as these. Furthermore,
this script mucks around with a lot of spooky stuff, like filesystem wipes and bootloader shenanigans. If you really want to 'just get Arch going', I'd recommend something like [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) - a full fledged distro based on Arch, maintained by a lot of people who know what they're doing - in stark contrast to this repo's maintainer who is in all fairness just throwing commands at a VM until something resembling a functioning OS appears.
